#1 Write a query to identify the top 2 Power Users who sent the highest number of messages on Microsoft Teams in August 2022. Display the IDs of these 2 users along with the total number of messages they sent. Output the results in descending order based on the count of the messages.

Assumption:

No two users have sent the same number of messages in August 2022.

SELECT sender_id, count(*) as message_count
from messages
where date_trunc('month', sent_date) = '2022-08-01'
group by sender_id
order by message_count DESC
limit 2;

#2 Assume you're given a table containing job postings from various companies on the LinkedIn platform. Write a query to retrieve the count of companies that have posted duplicate job listings.

Definition:

Duplicate job listings are defined as two job listings within the same company that share identical titles and descriptions.

with job_cnt AS(
select company_id, title, description, count(job_id) as cnt from job_listings
group by 1,2,3)

select count(company_id)
from job_cnt
where cnt >1;

#3. Assume you're given two tables containing data about Facebook Pages and their respective likes (as in "Like a Facebook Page").

Write a query to return the IDs of the Facebook pages that have zero likes. The output should be sorted in ascending order based on the page IDs.
SELECT p.page_id 
from pages  p
left join page_likes l
on p.page_id = l.page_id
where l.page_id is null
order by ppage_id;

SELECT page_id
FROM pages
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT page_id
  FROM page_likes AS likes
  WHERE likes.page_id = pages.page_id
)
order by page_id;

SELECT page_id
FROM pages
EXCEPT
SELECT page_id
FROM page_likes
order by page_id;
